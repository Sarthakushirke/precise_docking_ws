[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibpointmatcher_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "libpointmatcher_ros", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "libpointmatcher_ros" with any of the following names:

    libpointmatcher_rosConfig.cmake
    libpointmatcher_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libpointmatcher_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "libpointmatcher_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "libpointmatcher_ros" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
